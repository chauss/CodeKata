# What to do (simply said)

## Part One

Read the weather data from weather.txt and calculate the day with the lowest and the highest weather spread (difference between min and max temprature).

First column is the day, second column the max temp, third column the min temp.

# Kata Questions

- To what extent did the design decisions you made when writing the original programs make it easier or harder to factor out common code?

- Was the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?

- Is factoring out as much common code as possible always a good thing? Did the readability of the programs suffer because of this requirement? How about the maintainability?
