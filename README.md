# Code Kata
This Repo contains the CodeKatas that I have done as well as their sources.


## What is a CodeKata?
To become an experienced developer it needs practice, reading books, maybe talent but especially a lot of experience. Therefor it is important to to the basics and repeat them like a musician repeats the same song over and over again until its mastered. 

This is where the CodeKata enters the stage. It is a basic problem or technic that developers have to face every day. Many of those are hidden in some libraries and you only use them by making one function call. These CodeKatas help you to keep your fingers smooth and your brain sharp. 

Usually these CodeKatas are also a perfect opportunity to enter the world of Test Driven Development (TDD). The task is often to implement a function of basic logic that we use in our everyday and there is not much that we can better write a test for than a function with pure logic and a defined input / output.
