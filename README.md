# CodeKata

This Repo contains the CodeKatas that I have done as well as their sources.

## What is a CodeKata?

To become an experienced developer it needs practice, reading books, maybe talent but especially a lot of experience. Therefor it is important to do the basics and repeat them like a musician repeats the same song over and over again until its deep down in your head.

This is where the CodeKata enters the stage. It is a basic problem or technic that developers have to face every day. Many of those are hidden in some libraries and you only use them by making a function call to library xy. To come back to those problems and understand them helps you to keep your fingers smooth and your brain sharp.
